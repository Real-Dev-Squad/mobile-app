- For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [React Native environment setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

**Note:** Ensure that your React Native development environment is set up correctly to run the Hello World app in RN. Share a video link of your setup in the #react-native channel on Discord.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local App Setup

To get started with the development setup:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/mobile-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```
   cd mobile-app
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   yarn
   ```
4. **Start the Application**
   ```
   yarn start
   ```

## üì≤ Running the App on Android

### Step-by-Step Setup for Android:

1. **Start the Development Server**
   - Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
     ```
     yarn start
     ```
2. **Open Android Studio**
   - Open Android Studio and ensure you have a virtual device (emulator) configured.
   - If not, go to **AVD Manager** and create a new virtual device.
3. **Launch the Android Emulator**
   - Start the emulator from Android Studio or connect a physical device via USB (ensure USB debugging is enabled on your device).
4. **Install the App on the Emulator/Device**
   - Go back to the terminal and press:
     ```
     a
     ```
   - This will automatically build and install the app on the connected device/emulator.
5. **Manual Installation (if step 4 fails)**
   - Open Android Studio, navigate to `android` folder inside your project.
   - Click on **Build** > **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** > **Build APK**.
   - After the build completes, install the APK on your device manually.

### Troubleshooting:

- If you encounter errors related to build tools or environment configurations, ensure that your Android SDK is up-to-date.
- If you have issues with device/emulator connectivity, restart ADB using:
  ```
  adb kill-server
  adb start-server
  ```

## üì≤ Running the App on iOS

### Step-by-Step Setup for iOS:

1. **Start the Development Server**
   - Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
     ```
     yarn start
     ```
2. **Open Xcode**
   - Navigate to the `ios` folder inside your project.
   - Open the `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
3. **Select a Simulator**
   - Choose an iOS simulator from the top bar of Xcode (e.g., iPhone 14).
4. **Install the App on the Simulator**
   - Press the `Run` button in Xcode (or use the shortcut `Cmd + R`).
5. **Install on a Physical Device**
   - Connect your iPhone via USB.
   - In Xcode, select your device as the target and ensure the app is signed correctly using your Apple Developer account.
   - Click `Run` to install the app on your iPhone.

### Troubleshooting:

- If you encounter errors related to pods or library installations, run the following commands inside the `ios` folder:
  ```
  cd ios
  pod install
  cd ..
  ```
- If Xcode shows a signing error, ensure your app‚Äôs bundle identifier is unique and configured correctly.
